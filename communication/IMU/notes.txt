ICTFS is the good one, but it needs some tweaks (degrees going up)
ICTFS v0.2 idk if it worked
ICTFS v0.3 is the one from adafruit. It works-ish, but some of the measurements are kinda faulty.
ICTFS v0.4 needs a lot of tweaks.

Namely,
- roll pitch and yaw are approximately half of what they need to be
- degrees are going up like crazy
- degrees can go past 359 and below 0 degrees (shouldn't happen)
